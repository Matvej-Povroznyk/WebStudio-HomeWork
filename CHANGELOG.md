## [v.2025-07-15](https://github.com/Matvej-Povroznyk/WebStudio-HomeWork)

### Added / Removed:

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` to `./` in project.
- Created `svg/` folder:
  - Added `symbol-defs.svg` to `svg/`:
    > This file serves as an SVG sprite sheet containing multiple vector symbols that represent contact and social media icons.  
    > Each icon is defined inside `<symbol>` elements with unique IDs, allowing them to be efficiently referenced throughout the application using the `<use>` tag in HTML.
    >
    > Benefits:
    >
    > - **Performance:** Reduces HTTP requests by consolidating icons into a single SVG file.
    > - **Maintainability:** Centralized location for icon definitions makes updates easier.
    > - **Scalability:** Easy to add or remove icons without altering HTML structure.
    >
    > This approach helps keep markup clean and lightweight, leveraging SVGâ€™s native support for reusable graphics.
